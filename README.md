# Goal-Based Savings Tracker with Email Nudges

> n8n, Google Sheets & Gemini AI

---

This workflow automates goal-based savings tracking by pulling user data from Google Sheets, calculating progress and sending AI-generated motivational nudges via email. It evaluates whether users are ahead, on track or behind schedule and dynamically adjusts savings advice using an AI model.

### Quick Start Guide (Get Running in Minutes)

1. Login to your **[n8n account](https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/om1efg2qgvwi)**.
2. Connect your **Google Sheets account** and map required columns.
3. Add your **Gemini API credentials** (or any LLM provider).
4. Connect your **Gmail account** for sending emails.
5. Replace the **Manual Trigger** with a **Schedule Trigger (daily)**.
6. Test the workflow with sample data.
7. Activate the workflow.

## What It Does

This workflow acts as a smart financial assistant that helps users stay on track with their savings goals. It fetches savings data from a Google Sheet, processes it to calculate key metrics like progress percentage, expected savings and remaining days and determines whether the user is ahead, on track or behind schedule.

Based on this evaluation, the workflow generates personalized financial nudges using an AI agent. These nudges include motivational messages, practical advice and updated daily savings targets tailored to the user's current progress.

Finally, the workflow formats this information into a structured email and sends it directly to the user, creating a fully automated feedback loop that encourages consistent saving behavior.
